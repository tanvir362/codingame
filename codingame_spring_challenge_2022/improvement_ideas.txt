- throw monster out of the base according to line from center of the base (no need)
- if a monster is shielded dont cast spell, defend (done)
- shield own hero to be protected from opponent heros magic (need improvement)
- need to think if it's better casting wind or controll while defending inside my base (done)
- check if there is enough monsters inside enemy base if not go outside and control to enemy base (todo)
